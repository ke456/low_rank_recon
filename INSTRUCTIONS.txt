The DQN related files are in the directory MDP, written in Python using mostly pytorch and sklearn.
The CBCTree codes are written in C++ in the directory tree.

To train DQN, run:
python3 train_all
This will save all trained networks into saved_models. 

To generate the schedule of updates using the models, run:
python3 run_agents
This will save the runs to agent_runs

To compile the C++ code, simply run:
./compile_all

This script will take everything and output the test results
./run_all

You can find the test results in the directory results

## Incoorperating Feedback
Ordered in priority.

| Feedback    | Action items           | Assigned to     |
| :------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Find larger datasets to justify results (More features) | <ul><li>[ ] Test the method on new dataset</li><li>[ ] Graph & Write-up new findings</li></ul>| Triaged | 
| Clarify how CBCT identifies nearest points by clustering | <ul><li>[ ] Justify how clustering is an appropriate method to identify nearest points.</li></ul> | Triaged |
| The cost function is uniform for all features | <ul><li>[ ] Test the method with random cost functions</li></ul> | Triaged |
| Why can't Naive bayes by Chai et al. be used? | <ul><li>[ ] Look into the method</li><li>[ ] Survey the field for other potential methods which address this problem indirectly</li><li>[ ] Benchmark other methods, if any</li></ul>| Triaged | 
| No reference to Figure 3 and Figure 5 is confusing | <ul><li>[ ] Revisit these graphs and determine whether or not we need it </li></ul> | Triaged |
| Language could be improved | <ul><li>[ ] Edit writing once above changes are made.</li></ul> | Triaged |
| No code provided | <ul><li>[ ] Clean-up code to distribute</li></ul> | Triaged |

    
## Other top-of-mind work

| Feedback    | Action items           | Assigned to     |
| :------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Elaborate on the relation to sub-areas such as feature acquisition | <ul><li>[ ] Research other sub-area techniques</li><li>[ ] Write-up findings and relations</li></ul>| Triaged | 
| Which clustering algorithm is used in the experiments? | <ul><li>[ ] Mention K-means in Experimentation section</li></ul>| Triaged | 
| How does the algorithm deal with missing values? | <ul><li>[ ] Think about how missing values affects the algorithms.</li></ul>| Triaged | 
| Legend is too small | <ul><li>[ ] Make legend axis larger/enlarge graphs</li></ul> | Triaged |
| Several other works we could explore | <ul><li>[ ] Test-Cost Sensitive Classification on Data with Missing Values, Yang et al. TKDE 2006</li><li>[ ] Zhao H, Li X. A cost sensitive decision tree algorithm based on weighted class distribution with batch deleting attribute mechanism. Inf Sci 2016</li><li>[ ] Feng S. A cost-sensitive decision tree under the condition of multiple classes. In: International Conference on Logistics Engineering, Management and Computer Science; 2015</li><li>[ ] Test-Cost Sensitive Classification Based on Conditioned Loss Functions, Cebe and Demir, ECML 2007</li></ul> | Triaged |

We can also open source the code once we've cleaned it up
